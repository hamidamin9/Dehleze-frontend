            <h2>What is shipping rate policy?</h2>
            <p>
              Shipping fees are the charges received by Dehleze to ship items to
              a buyer. For every order that is delivered, Dehleze charges a
              certain amount from the customer as the shipping fee. However if
              the actual shipping fee is different than the estimated shipping
              fee due to incorrect weight or dimensions, then seller might be
              penalized with the difference in amount.

            <h2>How to calculate storage fee cost?</h2>
            <p>
              In order to continue providing the best possible services to our
              sellers and considering the marketplace recovery, we have
              implemented storage fee charges for items stored on marketplace
              consignment (FBD) with effect from 1st February 2023.  The limit
              for free days will be 60 days and you will not be charged storage
              fee for any item that is kept in our warehouse for less than 60
              days. This means that any inventory with ageing of more than 60
              days at the end of January 2023 will be charged a storage fee in
              the beginning of February 2023 as per applicable rate card. Please
              note this will be charged monthly for all items exceeding 60 days
              of ageing based on the stock at the last day of each month. The
              storage fee will be calculated based on the space occupied by the
              inventory in terms of cubic feet and the ageing of the inventory
              (days in the warehouse).

            <h2>What are the multiple store guidelines?</h2>
            <p>
              The multiple stores guidelines policy provides rules and
              regulations for individuals or businesses who want to operate more
              than one store on a platform. In order to provide a seamless
              seller and customer experience, Dehleze discourages its sellers to
              operate with more than one shop. You are not allowed to run more
              than one shop on Dehleze. For further information, please contact
              our Seller Support team.
              <h3>Guidelines Advisory</h3>
              Sellers are strongly advised to conduct themselves in a fair and
              professional manner on Dehleze. We do not tolerate compliance
              violations by sellers. Any seller who is found to have
              participated in any form of fair trade, seller behavior and
              product violations, Dehleze will not hesitate to take further
              actions to maintain a trusted, reliable and a healthy eCommerce
              community.
              <h3>Penalty for Failing to Comply</h3>
              Sellers who fail to comply with the above rules may be issued up
              to 48 non-compliance points. This may result in an immediate
              deactivation of the seller.

            <h2>What are the guidelines for buyer-seller communication?</h2>
            <p>
              All Sellers are prohibited from conducting immoral/inappropriate
              behavior which includes but may not be limited to:
              <br />
              1. Sending inappropriate and unsolicited spam messages or emails
              to customers or other sellers. Spam is a message or part of a
              message that is both unsolicited and commercial in nature.
              Unsolicited means that the recipient did not request the message.
              Commercial in nature means that the message discusses, buying,
              selling, and/or trading of goods and services. Sending threats to
              customers or other sellers using any mode of communication i.e.
              phone calls, text messages, emails. Displaying immoral behavior
              when answering customer questions on the Question and Answer
              Section. Example “Product is not expensive, you are poor" Using
              profanities and/or hate speech on Daraz Platform in communicating
              with customers and/or other sellers.
              <br />
              2. Sellers are encouraged to “Report” the question instead of
              replying to a question that is rude and inappropriate in order to
              hide it from the Question and Answer Section.
              <br />
              3. All Sellers are prohibited from sharing their personal
              information /asking for contact details on the Product Review
              Platform and/or Question and Answer Section of Daraz Platform or
              Initiating Communication with Customers off of Daraz. Example of
              sharing personal information: “Contact me at zero three four
              five…” or "Visit my website www.abc.com"
              <br />
              4. All sellers are prohibited from communicating with Daraz
              customers outside of the Question & Answer and Product Review
              Platform. Sellers are not allowed to induce buyers to conduct
              offline transactions. Offline transactions are transactions that
              originate from the Daraz platform but are executed and completed
              outside of the Daraz platform. Sellers who are found and verified
              to have violated our platform rules, by inducing buyers to
              complete offline transactions, will be penalized.
              <br />
              5. All sellers are required to respond to buyers within the agreed
              time frame as part of all sellers’ commitment to being trustworthy
              and reliable.
              <br />
              6. Standard SLA to reply to a customer query will be within
              working hours.
              <br />
              7. Daraz is dedicated to creating a trusted platform, connecting
              sellers to buyers, that promises an amazing online experience.
              Daraz does not allow any sellers (or buyers) to deliberately
              create any form of an unhappy transaction, in any manner, for each
              party.

              activities that sellers are not allowed to participate in. This is
              to inculcate professional and reliable seller behavior so that we
              can boost confidence and preserve the trust of shoppers for our

              issuance of up to 48 non-compliance points leading to restrictions
